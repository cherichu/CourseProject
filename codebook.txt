This data set present average of each features recodrded in "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" experiment for each activity and each subject.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals TimeofBodyAccelerometerXYZ and TimeofGravityAccelerometerXYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'Time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some signals with prefix 'Frequency'. 

'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The final data set is prepared in the following steps:

Step 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Merge processes are like the following:
1.1 Combine Test set (X_test.txt) and Training set (X_train.txt) as x_data
1.2 Combine Test Activities (Y_test.txt) and Training Activities (Y_train.txt) as y_data
1.3 Use feature names get from features.txt for x_data
1.4 Use "Activity" as column names for y_data
1.5 Combine test subject (subject_test.txt) and training subject (subject_train.txt) to be subject_data and add "Subject" as the column name
1.6 Combine x_data, subject_data, y_data to one data set, raw_merge_data

Step 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
         for each measurement. 
         
Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Step 5. From the data set in step 4, 
 creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for 
 each activity and each subject.
